# There are 15 tests in total, and there are no hidden tests for final grading.

# To run all tests:
    - Go to your src (turnin/p1b/ontime) directory. Run the command
      "/p/course/cs537-swift/tests/p3b/run-tests.sh -c ." without the quotes.
    - Tests which don't pass will come up in red. The description will
      explain how you can compare your program's output with the
      expected output.


# Run a failed test again:
    - To rerun a failed test, say test 3, go to the src directory and run
      "/p/course/cs537-swift/tests/p3b/run-tests.sh -t 3 ."


# Figure out input of failed test
    - /p/course/cs537-swift/tests/p3b/<test_no>.desc gives an overview of the
      test case
    - look at the contents of /p/course/cs537-swift/tests/p3b/<test_no>.run
